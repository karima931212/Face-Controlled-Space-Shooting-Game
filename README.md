# Face-Controlled-Space-Shooting-Game
A Single-player space shooting game controlled by the user’s face.
#### I use the FaceOSC, open-source software to monitor the user’s face and interact with Unity3D. It can only detect overt facial expressions such as blinking eyes, changing orientations and the mouth opening. I used these expressions to activate different virtual commands.Eventually, people can play the game with their face. 
1. The user can change the moving directions of the spaceship through his/her facial orientations.
2. The user can change the moving speed of the spaceship by slightly moving forward or backward. 
3. The user can shoot meteorites and other spaceships by opening their mouth.
